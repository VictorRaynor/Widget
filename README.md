## Features

This example covers the following features:  
- widget view in SwiftUI
- creating Timeline for remote data (mocked API call)
- support for widget configurations
- intent extension for dynamic data in configuration
- support for smart stacks (donating)
- deeplinks - navigation to application from widget

## Requirements
- Xcode 12+  

Xcode 12.0.1 seems to be the most stable in terms of WidgetKit. On Xcode 12.1 I noticed some problems.
